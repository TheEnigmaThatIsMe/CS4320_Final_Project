This project is to create a functioning RISK game that can be played over a network. To achieve this we use a server and web client to host the game. Many features are still under work and as a result not finished or buggy. Code that is downloaded will be used at the users own risk.

To setup:

Migrate website folder to web server and set up correct URL path access.

Set riskDataTables folder up on PostgreSQL server and import with \i.

Risk_map_UI also goes on web server to be used as the actual gameplay files.
