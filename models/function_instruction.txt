This is an instruction of game function
1.move_function is the function to move the armies,you can use database
command to pass query to this function.we will use MVC.so you can put this
code in the model,thus,I put this code in the commment.In this function,you
need to check if the number of troops is more than 1 and if the two countries
are adjacent.

2.attack_function also needs the database command.so I also put the code in the
query.In this function,you also need to check if the number of troops is more
than 1 and determine the number of dices according to the number of
troops.Then you can compare the maximum of two players' dices.If the
attacker's number is bigger than the defender then the victor is
attacker,otherwise is defender.you need to update your database after attack
function.so I put the database command in the comment, you will use it in the
model.you will also need to determine if the country is occupied according to
the number of troops of defender.If the country is occupied,you also need to
update the owner of country besides the number of armies.

3.drawcard_function needs the free cards' ID and the number of cards the player
owned.you can get this from database so you can put the code in model.I have
put the code you need in model in the comment.you can get a card which has no
owner and then updata the riskcards table and player table.If your own card
now is equal or more than 7.you need to trade your card use trade function.

4.tradecard_function needs the details of the card you own.you can calculate
the type of cards you own.if the number of the same kind of cards is equal or
more than 3,then you need to update the table of riskcards to set this cards'
owner_id to 0,otherwise,you need to hint the player he cannot trade cards.

PS:we will use javascript later to give the samll window to let them choose if
they will continue attack or not.How many troops they will move.and hint them
if they can trade cards or not.
